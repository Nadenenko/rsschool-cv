    <p>
        I am 29 years old. Originally from St. Petersburg, I moved to Tbilisi with my husband.
        My strong point is that if I fall in love with a job, I can do it to the pulse of it. My goal is to fall in love
        with a job and become independent. </p>
       <p> 
        I worked in the restaurant business for more than 10 years. During that time,
        I have learned how to sell a product and understand what the customer wants. But the most important thing that
        working in the catering industry teaches me is teamwork.</p>
<p>
        I have no experience in programming.
        </p>

       <p> My current English level is A2. But when I am in company with a foreigner, I get along well with him and we
        understand each other. I just need more practice.
