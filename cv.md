I am 29 years old. Originally from St. Petersburg, I moved to Tbilisi with my husband. 
My strong point is that if I fall in love with a job, I can do it to the pulse of it. My goal is to fall in love with a job and become independent. I worked in the restaurant business for more than 10 years. During that time, I have learned how to sell a product and understand what the customer wants. But the most important thing that working in the catering industry teaches me is teamwork.

I have no experience in programming.

My current English level is A2. But when I am in company with a foreigner, I get along well with him and we understand each other. I just need more practice.
